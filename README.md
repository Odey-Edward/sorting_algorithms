**0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O**

* C
* Algorithm
* Data structure

This is a group project.


**Learning Objectives:**
At the end of this project, we learnt several sorting algorithms, and thier differnt **Big O** complexity.

General  
At least four different sorting algorithms    
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm  
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input  
What is a stable sorting algorithm  


* in the best case
* in the average case
* in the worst case
